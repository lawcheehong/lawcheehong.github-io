        <h3>Synopsis</h3>
        <p>
          Twelve years before the start of the series, the Nine-Tails attacked
          Konohagakure destroying much of the village and taking many lives. The
          leader of the village, the Fourth Hokage, sacrificed his life to seal
          the Nine-Tails into a newborn, Naruto Uzumaki. Orphaned by the attack,
          Naruto was shunned by the villagers, who out of fear and anger, viewed
          him as the Nine-Tails itself. Though the Third Hokage outlawed
          speaking about anything related to the Nine-Tails, the children —
          taking their cues from their parents — inherited the same animosity
          towards Naruto. In his thirst to be acknowledged, Naruto vowed he
          would one day become the greatest Hokage the village had ever seen.

          <h3>Naruto</h3>
          <p>
            The plot of Naruto is told during the first 238 chapters of the
            manga and all 220 episodes of the Naruto anime. In the manga, before
            the switch to the second part of the series, otherwise known as
            Naruto: Shippūden, the story of Kakashi Gaiden is told.<br />
            <br />Kakashi Gaiden (カカシ外伝, Viz: Kakashi Chronicles, literally
            meaning: Kakashi Side Story), known as The Kakashi Side Story ~ A
            Boy's Life on the Battlefield ~ (カカシ外伝～戦場のボーイズライフ～,
            Kakashi Gaiden ~Senjō no Bōizu Raifu~) in the anime, is an arc of
            the series, which functions as an intermission between Parts I and
            II of the manga. It was later adapted into two Shippūden episodes:
            119 and 120. This arc explores how Kakashi Hatake gained his
            Sharingan. In the manga, it is preceded by the Sasuke Recovery
            Mission and followed by the Kazekage Rescue Mission. In the anime,
            this arc takes place in the middle of the Itachi Pursuit Mission.

          <h3>Naruto: Shippūden</h3>
          <p>
            The plot of the second part of the manga and anime series Naruto,
            titled Naruto: Shippūden (疾風伝, literally meaning: Hurricane
            Chronicles) in the anime and simply Part II in the manga, was set
            two and a half years after the present timeline in Part I. The new
            setting for the series began with volume 28 (chapter 245) of the
            manga. The anime adaptation of the manga started airing on February
            15 2007, premiering with the first two episodes debuting in a
            one-hour special. Viz is working on a North American DVD series of
            Naruto: Shippūden, which was first released on September 29, 2009.
            The US publication of the manga began in January 2008, in the US
            issue of Shonen Jump.
